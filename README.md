Diwali Sales Analysis Project
Project Overview:

This project delved into the intricacies of Diwali sales patterns using Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Google Colab. By leveraging libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, comprehensive insights were extracted from the dataset.

Key Findings:

Target Customer Profile: Married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, employed in IT, Aviation, or Healthcare sectors, exhibited the highest purchasing propensity.
Product Categories: Food, clothing, and electronics emerged as the most sought-after product categories among the target demographic.
Conclusion:

The analysis underscores the significance of tailoring marketing strategies towards the identified customer segment. By focusing on the preferences of married women within the specified age group, geographic locations, and occupational domains, businesses can optimize their product offerings and promotional efforts to maximize sales during the Diwali season.

Potential Next Steps:

Conduct in-depth customer segmentation analysis to identify sub-groups within the target market.
Explore the impact of pricing and discounts on purchase behavior.
Analyze customer lifetime value to assess long-term profitability.
Develop predictive models to forecast future sales trends.
By building upon these findings, businesses can gain a competitive edge and achieve sustained growth in the Diwali market.
